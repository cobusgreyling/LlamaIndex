Outbreaks of contagious diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to adversely impact the business, financial condition, and results of operations. Catastrophic events such as disease, weather events, war, or terrorist attacks could also have adverse impacts. The use of artificial intelligence presented additional risks, including potential flaws in algorithms or biased information in datasets. Climate change related physical and transition risks were also a concern, including market shifts towards electric vehicles and lower carbon business models, and risks related to extreme weather events or natural disasters. Economic conditions and their impact on discretionary consumer spending could harm the business and operating results. Increases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect operating results.\n",
            "\u001b[0mGot output: The risk factors in September 2022 included failure to meet regulatory requirements related to climate change or to meet stated climate change commitments, which could impact costs, operations, brand, and reputation. Outbreaks of contagious diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to adversely impact the business, financial condition, and results of operations. Catastrophic events such as disease, weather events, war, or terrorist attacks could also have adverse impacts. The use of artificial intelligence presented additional risks, including potential flaws in algorithms or biased information in datasets. Climate change related physical and transition risks were also a concern, including market shifts towards electric vehicles and lower carbon business models, and risks related to extreme weather events or natural disasters. Economic conditions and their impact on discretionary consumer spending could harm the business and operating results. Increases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect operating results.\n",

            "Response: In June 2022, Uber faced several risk factors. One of the main risks was the inherent danger of operating motor vehicles, especially with the growth of their Delivery offering which increased the number of Couriers on two-wheel vehicles like scooters and bicycles. These Couriers are more vulnerable to accidents and injuries, particularly in congested urban areas. Their auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims, which could increase their operating costs and negatively affect their business.\n",

These ventures are inherently risky and there's no guarantee that they will realize any expected benefits from them. If they fail to spend their development budget efficiently or if their new initiatives do not gain sufficient market acceptance, their business could be harmed.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another risk factor was their dependence on operations outside the United States, particularly in markets where they have limited experience. As of June 2022, they operated in approximately 70 countries, and markets outside the United States accounted for approximately 75% of all Trips. If they are unable to manage the risks presented by their international business model, their financial results and future prospects could be adversely impacted.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lastly, the COVID-19 pandemic posed a significant risk to Uber. The pandemic had adversely affected their near-term financial results and could continue to impact their long-term financial results.

The company's growth rates had slowed in recent periods and were expected to continue to slow. A significant portion of Uber's expenses and investments were fixed, and if revenue was less than expected, it could result in losses exceeding expectations. The company was also susceptible to conditions in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports, where it generates a significant percentage of its Gross Bookings.\\n\\nIn summary, while Uber's revenue growth was higher in March 2022, the risk factors became more diverse and complex by September 2022, reflecting the company's evolving business environment and challenges.\", source_nodes=[NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='96129294-eba9-4857-b9c2-7bb51423d5e4', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text=\"Query: What is Uber's revenue growth and risk factors in March 2022?\\nResponse: Uber's revenue in March 2022 was $6.9 billion, which was a 136% increase year-over-year. The growth in revenue outpaced Gross Bookings growth primarily due to a $1.5 billion increase in the Freight business, a favorable impact to revenue of $200 million due to a change in the accounting model for the UK Mobility business, and a favorable comparative impact to the same period in 2021.\\n\\nHowever, Uber also identified several risk factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainty and has had an adverse impact on Uber's business and operations, particularly by reducing the global demand for Mobility offerings. The extent of the pandemic's impact on Uber's business and financial results will depend on future developments, including the duration of the outbreak, the efficacy of vaccines, the impact on financial markets, and potential permanent changes to end-users’ behavior. \\n\\nUber's operating results may also fluctuate due to a variety of factors, some of which are beyond their control, such as seasonal fluctuations in financial results. For instance, Mobility typically generates higher revenue in the fourth quarter due to holiday and business demand, and lower revenue in the third quarter due to less usage of the platform during peak vacation season in certain cities. \\n\\nFurthermore, if Uber's growth slows more significantly than expected, it may not be able to achieve profitability, which would adversely affect its financial results and future prospects. Factors that could impact Uber's growth include its ability to grow supply and demand on its platform, compete with competitors' products and offerings, develop new products, and maintain existing local regulations in key markets where it operates.\\n\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=1.0), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='1117164a-6412-4ccf-b4e9-48fd5fe870d9', embedding=None, metadata={}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text=\"Query: What is Uber's revenue growth and risk factors in September 2022?\\nResponse: In September 2022, Uber's revenue increased by 72% for the three months ended, and by 99% for the nine months ended, compared to the same periods in 2021. This growth was primarily due to an increase in Gross Bookings, recovery from the impacts of COVID-19, and a significant increase in Freight Gross Bookings resulting from the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021.\\n\\nHowever, Uber also faced several risk factors. These included the ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition, the ability to expand operations in new and existing markets, changes in governmental regulations affecting the business, and harm to the brand or reputation.
