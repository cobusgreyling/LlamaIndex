The large unknown category is\\npartially made up of programming code data.\\nSafety Benchmarks for Pretrained Models.\\nWe evaluate the safety capabilities of Llama 2 on three popular\\nautomatic benchmarks, pertaining to three key dimensions of LM safety.\\n1. Truthfulness, referring to whether a language model produces known falsehoods due to misconcep-\\ntions or false beliefs. We employ TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021) to measure how well our LLMs can\\ngenerate reliable outputs that agree with factuality and common sense.\\n2. Toxicity, defined as the tendency of a language model to generate toxic, rude, adversarial, or implicitly\\nhateful content. We choose ToxiGen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022) to measure the amount of generation\\nof toxic language and hate speech across different groups.\\n3. Bias, defined as how model generations reproduce existing stereotypical social biases. We use\\nBOLD (Dhamala et al., 2021) to study how the sentiment in model generations may vary with\\ndemographic attributes.\\nWe compare the performance of Llama 2 with Llama 1 (Touvron et al., 2023), Falcon (Almazrouei et al.,\\n2023), and MPT (MosaicML NLP Team et al., 2023) in Table 11. For decoding, we set temperature to 0.1\\nand use nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020) with top-p set to 0.9. For TruthfulQA, we present the\\npercentage of generations that are both truthful and informative (the higher, the better). For ToxiGen, we\\npresent the percentage of generations that are deemed toxic by the metric (the lower, the better). Detailed\\ndescriptions of the benchmarks and metrics can be found in Appendix A.4.7. When compared to Llama 1-7B,\\nLlama 2-7B demonstrates a 21.37% increase in truthfulness and informativeness and a 7.61% decrease in\\ntoxicity. We also observe an increase in toxicity in the pretrained 13B and 70B Llama 2, which may result\\nfrom larger pretraining data or a different dataset mix. Some have postulated the existence of a relationship\\nbetween pretraining dataset size and downstream model toxicity or bias (Bender et al., 2021b), but empirical\\nwork to validate this claim is still ongoing (Dodge et al., 2021; Smith and Williams, 2021; Tal et al., 2022), and\\nfurther evidence from up-to-date models is still needed.\\nIn Appendix A.4.7, we present bias metrics, such as how the sentiment of model generations varies with\\ndemographic attributes. We note an increase in positive sentiment overall for many of the groups using\\nBOLD prompts. More detailed results split by different demographic groups can be found in Appendix A.4.8.\\nLlama 2 does not outperform other models on toxicity metrics, and we speculate that this may be because we\\nrefrained from aggressively filtering the pretraining data. Recall that leaving pretraining data unfiltered may\\nenable base models tuned to perform well on more downstream tasks (including hate speech detection),\\nand it carries less risk of accidentally filtering out some demographic groups. We observe that models\\ntrained from less aggressively filtered pretraining data also required fewer examples to achieve reasonable\\nsafety-alignment. We reiterate that this motivated choice does imply that additional safety mitigations should\\nbe applied before deployment of base Llama 2 models.\\n22\\n---------------------\\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\\nQuery: What is the scale range of the pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) developed in this work?\\nAnswer: ', '3': 'Context information is below.\\n---------------------\\nLlama 2: Open Foundation and Fine-Tuned Chat Models\\nHugo Touvron∗\\nLouis Martin†\\nKevin Stone†\\nPeter Albert Amjad Almahairi Yasmine Babaei Nikolay Bashlykov Soumya Batra\\nPrajjwal Bhargava Shruti Bhosale Dan Bikel Lukas Blecher Cristian Canton Ferrer Moya Chen\\nGuillem Cucurull David Esiobu Jude Fernandes Jeremy Fu Wenyin Fu Brian Fuller\\nCynthia Gao Vedanuj Goswami Naman Goyal Anthony Hartshorn Saghar Hosseini Rui Hou\\nHakan Inan Marcin Kardas Viktor Kerkez Madian Khabsa Isabel Kloumann Artem Korenev\\nPunit Singh Koura Marie-Anne Lachaux Thibaut Lavril Jenya Lee Diana Liskovich\\nYinghai Lu Yuning Mao Xavier Martinet Todor Mihaylov Pushkar Mishra\\nIgor Molybog Yixin Nie Andrew Poulton Jeremy Reizenstein Rashi Rungta Kalyan Saladi\\nAlan Schelten Ruan Silva Eric Michael Smith Ranjan Subramanian Xiaoqing Ellen Tan Binh Tang\\nRoss Taylor Adina Williams Jian Xiang Kuan Puxin Xu Zheng Yan Iliyan Zarov Yuchen Zhang\\nAngela Fan Melanie Kambadur Sharan Narang Aurelien Rodriguez Robert Stojnic\\nSergey Edunov\\nThomas Scialom∗\\nGenAI, Meta\\nAbstract\\nIn this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned\\nlarge language models (LLMs) ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters.\\nOur fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama 2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases.

To remove\\nties, we used win/(win + loss). The orders in\\nwhich the model responses are presented to\\nGPT-4 are randomly swapped to alleviate bias.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise as highly capable AI assistants that excel in\\ncomplex reasoning tasks requiring expert knowledge across a wide range of fields, including in specialized\\ndomains such as programming and creative writing. They enable interaction with humans through intuitive\\nchat interfaces, which has led to rapid and widespread adoption among the general public.\\nThe capabilities of LLMs are remarkable considering the seemingly straightforward nature of the training\\nmethodology. Auto-regressive transformers are pretrained on an extensive corpus of self-supervised data,\\nfollowed by alignment with human preferences via techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human\\nFeedback (RLHF). Although the training methodology is simple, high computational requirements have\\nlimited the development of LLMs to a few players. There have been public releases of pretrained LLMs\\n(such as BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023)) that\\nmatch the performance of closed pretrained competitors like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Chinchilla\\n(Hoffmann et al., 2022), but none of these models are suitable substitutes for closed “product” LLMs, such\\nas ChatGPT, BARD, and Claude. These closed product LLMs are heavily fine-tuned to align with human\\npreferences, which greatly enhances their usability and safety. This step can require significant costs in\\ncompute and human annotation, and is often not transparent or easily reproducible, limiting progress within\\nthe community to advance AI alignment research.\\nIn this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a family of pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs, Llama 2 and\\nLlama 2-Chat, at scales up to 70B parameters. On the series of helpfulness and safety benchmarks we tested,\\nLlama 2-Chat models generally perform better than existing open-source models. They also appear to\\nbe on par with some of the closed-source models, at least on the human evaluations we performed (see\\nFigures 1 and 3). We have taken measures to increase the safety of these models, using safety-specific data\\nannotation and tuning, as well as conducting red-teaming and employing iterative evaluations. Additionally,\\nthis paper contributes a thorough description of our fine-tuning methodology and approach to improving\\nLLM safety. We hope that this openness will enable the community to reproduce fine-tuned LLMs and\\ncontinue to improve the safety of those models, paving the way for more responsible development of LLMs.\\nWe also share novel observations we made during the development of Llama 2 and Llama 2-Chat, such as\\nthe emergence of tool usage and temporal organization of knowledge.\\n3\\n---------------------\\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\\nQuery: How do the Llama 2-Chat models compare to open-source chat models based on the benchmarks tested?\\nAnswer: ', '5': 'Context information is below.\\n---------------------\\nThese code samples are available\\nhere: https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama. Finally, we are sharing a Responsible Use Guide, which\\nprovides guidelines regarding safe development and deployment.\\nResponsible Release.\\nWhile many companies have opted to build AI behind closed doors, we are releasing\\nLlama 2 openly to encourage responsible AI innovation. Based on our experience, an open approach draws\\nupon the collective wisdom, diversity, and ingenuity of the AI-practitioner community to realize the benefits of\\nthis technology. Collaboration will make these models better and safer. The entire AI community—academic\\nresearchers, civil society, policymakers, and industry—must work together to rigorously analyze and expose\\nthe risks of current AI systems and to build solutions that address potentially problematic misuse. This\\napproach not only fosters real collaboration with diverse stakeholders—those beyond the walls of big tech\\ncompanies—but also serves as the cornerstone for democratizing access to foundational models. As argued\\nin Zellers et al. (2019b), open releases promote transparency and allow more people to access AI tools,\\ndemocratizing the technology and decentralizing AI expertise. We believe that the decentralization of AI\\nexpertise does more than simply distribute knowledge—it stimulates innovation and accelerates progress\\nin the industry. Lastly, openly releasing these models consolidates costs and eliminates barriers to entry,\\nallowing small businesses to leverage innovations in LLMs to explore and build text-generation use cases.\\nUltimately, we believe this will create a more level playing field for organizations of all sizes across the globe\\nto benefit from the economic growth promised by the advancement of AI.\\nWe know that not everyone who uses AI models has good intentions, and we acknowledge that there\\nare reasonable concerns regarding the ways that AI will impact our world. Toxic content generation and\\nproblematic associations are meaningful risks that the AI community has yet to fully mitigate. As this\\npaper illustrates, we have made strides in limiting the prevalence of these types of responses. While we\\nrecognize there is more work to be done, this realization only deepens our commitment to open science and\\ncollaboration with the AI community.\\n6\\nRelated Work\\nLarge Language Models.\\nThe recent years have witnessed a substantial evolution in the field of LLMs.\\nFollowing the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. (2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B\\nparameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or specialized\\nmodels, e.g. Galactica, for science(Taylor et al., 2022). With 70B parameters, Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al.,\\n2022) redefined those scaling laws towards the number of tokens rather than model weights. Notable in\\nthis progression is the rise of Llama, recognized for its focus on computational efficiency during inference\\n(Touvron et al., 2023).

We have instructed the annotators to avoid writing responses that violate our safety guidelines, for\\nexample, we ask that prompts they write do not:\\n1. Promote or enable criminal activities.\\n2. Promote or enable dangerous behaviors to the user or other people.\\n3. Contain, promote or enable offensive and abusive behavior towards the user or other people.\\n4. Contain, promote or enable sexually explicit content.\\nA.5.3\\nQuality Assurance Process\\nWe have implemented a quality assurance process to ensure we only use high quality annotations for training\\nthe model. For this process, a team of highly skilled content managers manually reviewed the annotations\\nand approved the ones that would be used.\\nDuring the quality assurance step, reviewers were asked to only approve those annotations that matched our\\nguidelines: (a) they are consistent with the dialogue history, (b) follow instructions in the prompt (c) are\\nfree of grammatical, spelling and other writing errors, and (d) do not fall into any of the categories described\\nin Section A.5.2. If an annotation needed small changes to be approved, due to grammar or spelling mistakes,\\nor to improve the structure, cohesiveness and style of the text, reviewers could edit it to fix the issues and\\napprove it. If the answer could not be approved without major changes, the reviewers were asked to reject it\\nand write the feedback necessary to improve it.\\nA.5.4\\nAnnotator Selection\\nTo select the annotators who could work on our different data collection tasks, we conducted a multi-step\\nassessment process where we tested their understanding of our guidelines, the alignment with our quality\\nassessment criteria, the alignment with our sensitive topics guidelines and their reading and writing skills.\\nThe process included 4 tests:\\n• The first test consists of 3 sections of testing to evaluate grammar, reading comprehension and writing\\nstyle. Each section is timed and the test should take a total of 50 minutes to complete. A candidate\\nmust score 90% on part I to continue on to parts II and III, and an average score of 4 on part II and III\\nto pass the test.\\n• The second test consisted of 42 questions split into sensitive topics alignment, answer ranking and\\ntwo examples of answer writing, which were manually reviewed by us. To pass the test, annotators\\nneeded to agree with our criteria on 80% of the answers, and pass the written examples with a score\\nof 4 out of 5.\\n74\\n\\n\\n• The third test consisted in measuring the alignment with our quality assessment criteria. The test\\nconsisted of 31 different questions asking the annotators to grade different prompt-answer pairs,\\nas well as ranking different answers to the same prompt. To measure alignment, we first collected\\nresponses from different team members, and the annotators who agreed with our preferences in\\nmore than 26 of the questions passed the test.\\n• Finally, the last test consisted of a prompt response assessment where annotators choose a minimum of\\n6 out of 18 prompts to write responses for. We manually assess each response to evaluate production\\nreadiness. Annotators that have scored an average of >4 have passed the training.\\nA.6\\nDataset Contamination\\nWith the increasing scale of publicly available training data, it has become inevitable that some portion of\\nevaluation data is seen during training, and may provide an undue boost in evaluation performance.\\nEarlier work (Brown et al.\\n---------------------\\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\\nQuery: What is the significance of the Section A.1 in the paper?\\nAnswer: ', '9': 'Context information is below.\\n---------------------\\nCategory\\nPrompt\\nCreative writing\\nWrite a short story about a dragon who was evil and then saw the error in [sic]\\nit’s ways\\nIdentity / Personas\\nYou are a unicorn.

Finally, we are sharing a Responsible Use Guide, which\\nprovides guidelines regarding safe development and deployment.\\nResponsible Release.\\nWhile many companies have opted to build AI behind closed doors, we are releasing\\nLlama 2 openly to encourage responsible AI innovation. Based on our experience, an open approach draws\\nupon the collective wisdom, diversity, and ingenuity of the AI-practitioner community to realize the benefits of\\nthis technology. Collaboration will make these models better and safer. The entire AI community—academic\\nresearchers, civil society, policymakers, and industry—must work together to rigorously analyze and expose\\nthe risks of current AI systems and to build solutions that address potentially problematic misuse. This\\napproach not only fosters real collaboration with diverse stakeholders—those beyond the walls of big tech\\ncompanies—but also serves as the cornerstone for democratizing access to foundational models. As argued\\nin Zellers et al. (2019b), open releases promote transparency and allow more people to access AI tools,\\ndemocratizing the technology and decentralizing AI expertise. We believe that the decentralization of AI\\nexpertise does more than simply distribute knowledge—it stimulates innovation and accelerates progress\\nin the industry. Lastly, openly releasing these models consolidates costs and eliminates barriers to entry,\\nallowing small businesses to leverage innovations in LLMs to explore and build text-generation use cases.\\nUltimately, we believe this will create a more level playing field for organizations of all sizes across the globe\\nto benefit from the economic growth promised by the advancement of AI.\\nWe know that not everyone who uses AI models has good intentions, and we acknowledge that there\\nare reasonable concerns regarding the ways that AI will impact our world. Toxic content generation and\\nproblematic associations are meaningful risks that the AI community has yet to fully mitigate. As this\\npaper illustrates, we have made strides in limiting the prevalence of these types of responses. While we\\nrecognize there is more work to be done, this realization only deepens our commitment to open science and\\ncollaboration with the AI community.\\n6\\nRelated Work\\nLarge Language Models.\\nThe recent years have witnessed a substantial evolution in the field of LLMs.\\nFollowing the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. (2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B\\nparameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or specialized\\nmodels, e.g. Galactica, for science(Taylor et al., 2022). With 70B parameters, Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al.,\\n2022) redefined those scaling laws towards the number of tokens rather than model weights. Notable in\\nthis progression is the rise of Llama, recognized for its focus on computational efficiency during inference\\n(Touvron et al., 2023). A parallel discourse has unfolded around the dynamics of open-source versus closed-\\nsource models. Open-source releases like BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), OPT(Zhang et al., 2022), and Falcon\\n(Penedo et al., 2023) have risen to challenge their closed-source counterparts like GPT-3 and Chinchilla.\\n§§https://ai.meta.com/llama\\n35\\n\\n\\nYet, when it comes to the \"production-ready\" LLMs such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, there’s a marked\\ndistinction in performance and usability.

We also\\nincreased the size of the pretraining corpus by 40%, doubled the context length of the model, and\\nadopted grouped-query attention (Ainslie et al., 2023). We are releasing variants of Llama 2 with\\n7B, 13B, and 70B parameters. We have also trained 34B variants, which we report on in this paper\\nbut are not releasing.§\\n2. Llama 2-Chat, a fine-tuned version of Llama 2 that is optimized for dialogue use cases. We release\\nvariants of this model with 7B, 13B, and 70B parameters as well.\\nWe believe that the open release of LLMs, when done safely, will be a net benefit to society. Like all LLMs,\\nLlama 2 is a new technology that carries potential risks with use (Bender et al., 2021b; Weidinger et al., 2021;\\nSolaiman et al., 2023). Testing conducted to date has been in English and has not — and could not — cover\\nall scenarios. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 2-Chat, developers should perform\\nsafety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model. We provide a responsible use\\nguide¶ and code examples‖ to facilitate the safe deployment of Llama 2 and Llama 2-Chat. More details of\\nour responsible release strategy can be found in Section 5.3.\\nThe remainder of this paper describes our pretraining methodology (Section 2), fine-tuning methodology\\n(Section 3), approach to model safety (Section 4), key observations and insights (Section 5), relevant related\\nwork (Section 6), and conclusions (Section 7).\\n‡https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama/\\n§We are delaying the release of the 34B model due to a lack of time to sufficiently red team.\\n¶https://ai.meta.com/llama\\n‖https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama\\n4\\n---------------------\\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\\nQuery: What is the purpose of providing a detailed description of the approach to fine-tuning and safety improvements of Llama 2-Chat?\\nAnswer: ', '3': 'Context information is below.\\n---------------------\\n52\\n0.44\\n0.45\\n0.29\\n0.46\\n0.49\\n0.50\\n0.48\\n0.29\\n0.31\\n0.58\\n0.41\\n0.58\\n0.33\\n0.40\\n34B\\n0.40\\n0.37\\n0.43\\n0.59\\n0.54\\n0.49\\n0.32\\n0.48\\n0.50\\n0.58\\n0.53\\n0.25\\n0.34\\n0.60\\n0.50\\n0.63\\n0.44\\n0.40\\n70B\\n0.47\\n0.43\\n0.49\\n0.67\\n0.60\\n0.55\\n0.38\\n0.54\\n0.56\\n0.61\\n0.58\\n0.28\\n0.39\\n0.67\\n0.56\\n0.70\\n0.43\\n0.47\\nTable 50: Distribution of mean sentiment scores across groups under the profession domain from the BOLD\\nprompts.\\nA.5.2\\nNegative User Experience Categories\\nThere are different kinds of responses that could cause a negative user experience when interacting with our\\nmodels. We have instructed the annotators to avoid writing responses that violate our safety guidelines, for\\nexample, we ask that prompts they write do not:\\n1. Promote or enable criminal activities.\\n2. Promote or enable dangerous behaviors to the user or other people.\\n3. Contain, promote or enable offensive and abusive behavior towards the user or other people.\\n4. Contain, promote or enable sexually explicit content.\\nA.5.3\\nQuality Assurance Process\\nWe have implemented a quality assurance process to ensure we only use high quality annotations for training\\nthe model. For this process, a team of highly skilled content managers manually reviewed the annotations\\nand approved the ones that would be used.\\nDuring the quality assurance step, reviewers were asked to only approve those annotations that matched our\\nguidelines: (a) they are consistent with the dialogue history, (b) follow instructions in the prompt (c) are\\nfree of grammatical, spelling and other writing errors, and (d) do not fall into any of the categories described\\nin Section A.5.2. If an annotation needed small changes to be approved, due to grammar or spelling mistakes,\\nor to improve the structure, cohesiveness and style of the text, reviewers could edit it to fix the issues and\\napprove it. If the answer could not be approved without major changes, the reviewers were asked to reject it\\nand write the feedback necessary to improve it.\\nA.5.4\\nAnnotator Selection\\nTo select the annotators who could work on our different data collection tasks, we conducted a multi-step\\nassessment process where we tested their understanding of our guidelines, the alignment with our quality\\nassessment criteria, the alignment with our sensitive topics guidelines and their reading and writing skills.\\nThe process included 4 tests:\\n• The first test consists of 3 sections of testing to evaluate grammar, reading comprehension and writing\\nstyle. Each section is timed and the test should take a total of 50 minutes to complete. A candidate\\nmust score 90% on part I to continue on to parts II and III, and an average score of 4 on part II and III\\nto pass the test.\\n• The second test consisted of 42 questions split into sensitive topics alignment, answer ranking and\\ntwo examples of answer writing, which were manually reviewed by us. To pass the test, annotators\\nneeded to agree with our criteria on 80% of the answers, and pass the written examples with a score\\nof 4 out of 5.\\n74\\n\\n\\n• The third test consisted in measuring the alignment with our quality assessment criteria. The test\\nconsisted of 31 different questions asking the annotators to grade different prompt-answer pairs,\\nas well as ranking different answers to the same prompt. To measure alignment, we first collected\\nresponses from different team members, and the annotators who agreed with our preferences in\\nmore than 26 of the questions passed the test.\\n• Finally, the last test consisted of a prompt response assessment where annotators choose a minimum of\\n6 out of 18 prompts to write responses for. We manually assess each response to evaluate production\\nreadiness. Annotators that have scored an average of >4 have passed the training.\\nA.6\\nDataset Contamination\\nWith the increasing scale of publicly available training data, it has become inevitable that some portion of\\nevaluation data is seen during training, and may provide an undue boost in evaluation performance.\\nEarlier work (Brown et al.\\n---------------------\\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\\nQuery: What is the significance of the Section A.1 in the paper?\\nAnswer: ', '4': 'Context information is below.\\n---------------------\\n. . . . . . . .\\n77\\n2\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: Helpfulness human evaluation results for Llama\\n2-Chat compared to other open-source and closed-source\\nmodels.

They enable interaction with humans through intuitive\\nchat interfaces, which has led to rapid and widespread adoption among the general public.\\nThe capabilities of LLMs are remarkable considering the seemingly straightforward nature of the training\\nmethodology. Auto-regressive transformers are pretrained on an extensive corpus of self-supervised data,\\nfollowed by alignment with human preferences via techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human\\nFeedback (RLHF). Although the training methodology is simple, high computational requirements have\\nlimited the development of LLMs to a few players. There have been public releases of pretrained LLMs\\n(such as BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023)) that\\nmatch the performance of closed pretrained competitors like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Chinchilla\\n(Hoffmann et al., 2022), but none of these models are suitable substitutes for closed “product” LLMs, such\\nas ChatGPT, BARD, and Claude. These closed product LLMs are heavily fine-tuned to align with human\\npreferences, which greatly enhances their usability and safety. This step can require significant costs in\\ncompute and human annotation, and is often not transparent or easily reproducible, limiting progress within\\nthe community to advance AI alignment research.\\nIn this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a family of pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs, Llama 2 and\\nLlama 2-Chat, at scales up to 70B parameters. On the series of helpfulness and safety benchmarks we tested,\\nLlama 2-Chat models generally perform better than existing open-source models. They also appear to\\nbe on par with some of the closed-source models, at least on the human evaluations we performed (see\\nFigures 1 and 3). We have taken measures to increase the safety of these models, using safety-specific data\\nannotation and tuning, as well as conducting red-teaming and employing iterative evaluations. Additionally,\\nthis paper contributes a thorough description of our fine-tuning methodology and approach to improving\\nLLM safety. We hope that this openness will enable the community to reproduce fine-tuned LLMs and\\ncontinue to improve the safety of those models, paving the way for more responsible development of LLMs.\\nWe also share novel observations we made during the development of Llama 2 and Llama 2-Chat, such as\\nthe emergence of tool usage and temporal organization of knowledge.\\n3\\n---------------------\\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\\nQuery: How do the Llama 2-Chat models compare to open-source chat models based on the benchmarks tested?\\nAnswer: ', '5': 'Context information is below.\\n---------------------\\nLlama 2: Open Foundation and Fine-Tuned Chat Models\\nHugo Touvron∗\\nLouis Martin†\\nKevin Stone†\\nPeter Albert Amjad Almahairi Yasmine Babaei Nikolay Bashlykov Soumya Batra\\nPrajjwal Bhargava Shruti Bhosale Dan Bikel Lukas Blecher Cristian Canton Ferrer Moya Chen\\nGuillem Cucurull David Esiobu Jude Fernandes Jeremy Fu Wenyin Fu Brian Fuller\\nCynthia Gao Vedanuj Goswami Naman Goyal Anthony Hartshorn Saghar Hosseini Rui Hou\\nHakan Inan Marcin Kardas Viktor Kerkez Madian Khabsa Isabel Kloumann Artem Korenev\\nPunit Singh Koura Marie-Anne Lachaux Thibaut Lavril Jenya Lee Diana Liskovich\\nYinghai Lu Yuning Mao Xavier Martinet Todor Mihaylov Pushkar Mishra\\nIgor Molybog Yixin Nie Andrew Poulton Jeremy Reizenstein Rashi Rungta Kalyan Saladi\\nAlan Schelten Ruan Silva Eric Michael Smith Ranjan Subramanian Xiaoqing Ellen Tan Binh Tang\\nRoss Taylor Adina Williams Jian Xiang Kuan Puxin Xu Zheng Yan Iliyan Zarov Yuchen Zhang\\nAngela Fan Melanie Kambadur Sharan Narang Aurelien Rodriguez Robert Stojnic\\nSergey Edunov\\nThomas Scialom∗\\nGenAI, Meta\\nAbstract\\nIn this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned\\nlarge language models (LLMs) ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters.\\nOur fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama 2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases.

Most data is in English,\\nmeaning that Llama 2 will perform best for English-language use cases. The large unknown category is\\npartially made up of programming code data.\\nSafety Benchmarks for Pretrained Models.\\nWe evaluate the safety capabilities of Llama 2 on three popular\\nautomatic benchmarks, pertaining to three key dimensions of LM safety.\\n1. Truthfulness, referring to whether a language model produces known falsehoods due to misconcep-\\ntions or false beliefs. We employ TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021) to measure how well our LLMs can\\ngenerate reliable outputs that agree with factuality and common sense.\\n2. Toxicity, defined as the tendency of a language model to generate toxic, rude, adversarial, or implicitly\\nhateful content. We choose ToxiGen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022) to measure the amount of generation\\nof toxic language and hate speech across different groups.\\n3. Bias, defined as how model generations reproduce existing stereotypical social biases. We use\\nBOLD (Dhamala et al., 2021) to study how the sentiment in model generations may vary with\\ndemographic attributes.\\nWe compare the performance of Llama 2 with Llama 1 (Touvron et al., 2023), Falcon (Almazrouei et al.,\\n2023), and MPT (MosaicML NLP Team et al., 2023) in Table 11. For decoding, we set temperature to 0.1\\nand use nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020) with top-p set to 0.9. For TruthfulQA, we present the\\npercentage of generations that are both truthful and informative (the higher, the better). For ToxiGen, we\\npresent the percentage of generations that are deemed toxic by the metric (the lower, the better). Detailed\\ndescriptions of the benchmarks and metrics can be found in Appendix A.4.7. When compared to Llama 1-7B,\\nLlama 2-7B demonstrates a 21.37% increase in truthfulness and informativeness and a 7.61% decrease in\\ntoxicity. We also observe an increase in toxicity in the pretrained 13B and 70B Llama 2, which may result\\nfrom larger pretraining data or a different dataset mix. Some have postulated the existence of a relationship\\nbetween pretraining dataset size and downstream model toxicity or bias (Bender et al., 2021b), but empirical\\nwork to validate this claim is still ongoing (Dodge et al., 2021; Smith and Williams, 2021; Tal et al., 2022), and\\nfurther evidence from up-to-date models is still needed.\\nIn Appendix A.4.7, we present bias metrics, such as how the sentiment of model generations varies with\\ndemographic attributes. We note an increase in positive sentiment overall for many of the groups using\\nBOLD prompts. More detailed results split by different demographic groups can be found in Appendix A.4.8.\\nLlama 2 does not outperform other models on toxicity metrics, and we speculate that this may be because we\\nrefrained from aggressively filtering the pretraining data. Recall that leaving pretraining data unfiltered may\\nenable base models tuned to perform well on more downstream tasks (including hate speech detection),\\nand it carries less risk of accidentally filtering out some demographic groups. We observe that models\\ntrained from less aggressively filtered pretraining data also required fewer examples to achieve reasonable\\nsafety-alignment. We reiterate that this motivated choice does imply that additional safety mitigations should\\nbe applied before deployment of base Llama 2 models.\\n22\\n---------------------\\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\\nQuery: What is the scale range of the pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) developed in this work?\\nAnswer: ', '1': 'Context information is below.\\n---------------------\\nAakanksha Chowdhery, Sharan Narang, Jacob Devlin, Maarten Bosma, Gaurav Mishra, Adam Roberts,\\nPaul Barham, Hyung Won Chung, Charles Sutton, Sebastian Gehrmann, Parker Schuh, Kensen Shi, Sasha\\nTsvyashchenko, Joshua Maynez, Abhishek Rao, Parker Barnes, Yi Tay, Noam Shazeer, Vinodkumar Prab-\\nhakaran, Emily Reif, Nan Du, Ben Hutchinson, Reiner Pope, James Bradbury, Jacob Austin, Michael Isard,\\nGuy Gur-Ari, Pengcheng Yin, Toju Duke, Anselm Levskaya, Sanjay Ghemawat, Sunipa Dev, Henryk\\nMichalewski, Xavier Garcia, Vedant Misra, Kevin Robinson, Liam Fedus, Denny Zhou, Daphne Ippolito,\\nDavid Luan, Hyeontaek Lim, Barret Zoph, Alexander Spiridonov, Ryan Sepassi, David Dohan, Shivani\\nAgrawal, Mark Omernick, Andrew M.

Finally, we are sharing a Responsible Use Guide, which\\nprovides guidelines regarding safe development and deployment.\\nResponsible Release.\\nWhile many companies have opted to build AI behind closed doors, we are releasing\\nLlama 2 openly to encourage responsible AI innovation. Based on our experience, an open approach draws\\nupon the collective wisdom, diversity, and ingenuity of the AI-practitioner community to realize the benefits of\\nthis technology. Collaboration will make these models better and safer. The entire AI community—academic\\nresearchers, civil society, policymakers, and industry—must work together to rigorously analyze and expose\\nthe risks of current AI systems and to build solutions that address potentially problematic misuse. This\\napproach not only fosters real collaboration with diverse stakeholders—those beyond the walls of big tech\\ncompanies—but also serves as the cornerstone for democratizing access to foundational models. As argued\\nin Zellers et al. (2019b), open releases promote transparency and allow more people to access AI tools,\\ndemocratizing the technology and decentralizing AI expertise. We believe that the decentralization of AI\\nexpertise does more than simply distribute knowledge—it stimulates innovation and accelerates progress\\nin the industry. Lastly, openly releasing these models consolidates costs and eliminates barriers to entry,\\nallowing small businesses to leverage innovations in LLMs to explore and build text-generation use cases.\\nUltimately, we believe this will create a more level playing field for organizations of all sizes across the globe\\nto benefit from the economic growth promised by the advancement of AI.\\nWe know that not everyone who uses AI models has good intentions, and we acknowledge that there\\nare reasonable concerns regarding the ways that AI will impact our world. Toxic content generation and\\nproblematic associations are meaningful risks that the AI community has yet to fully mitigate. As this\\npaper illustrates, we have made strides in limiting the prevalence of these types of responses. While we\\nrecognize there is more work to be done, this realization only deepens our commitment to open science and\\ncollaboration with the AI community.\\n6\\nRelated Work\\nLarge Language Models.\\nThe recent years have witnessed a substantial evolution in the field of LLMs.\\nFollowing the scaling laws of Kaplan et al. (2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B\\nparameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or specialized\\nmodels, e.g. Galactica, for science(Taylor et al., 2022). With 70B parameters, Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al.,\\n2022) redefined those scaling laws towards the number of tokens rather than model weights. Notable in\\nthis progression is the rise of Llama, recognized for its focus on computational efficiency during inference\\n(Touvron et al., 2023). A parallel discourse has unfolded around the dynamics of open-source versus closed-\\nsource models. Open-source releases like BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), OPT(Zhang et al., 2022), and Falcon\\n(Penedo et al., 2023) have risen to challenge their closed-source counterparts like GPT-3 and Chinchilla.\\n§§https://ai.meta.com/llama\\n35\\n\\n\\nYet, when it comes to the \"production-ready\" LLMs such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, there’s a marked\\ndistinction in performance and usability. These models rely on intricate tuning techniques to align with\\nhuman preferences (Gudibande et al., 2023), a process that is still being explored and refined within the\\nopen-source community.\\nAttempts to close this gap have emerged, with distillation-based models such as Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023)\\nand Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) adopting a unique approach to training with synthetic instructions (Honovich\\net al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022). However, while these models show promise, they still fall short of the bar set\\nby their closed-source counterparts.\\nInstruction Tuning.\\nWei et al. (2021) obtained zero-shot performance on unseen tasks by fine-tuning LLMs\\non numerous datasets. Chung et al. (2022) and Longpre et al. (2023) investigate the impact of instruction\\ntuning as a function of number of tasks, model size, prompt settings, etc.\\n---------------------\\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\\nQuery: What is the potential substitute for closed-source models according to the paper?\\nAnswer: ', '2': 'Context information is below.\\n---------------------\\nFigure 3: Safety human evaluation results for Llama 2-Chat compared to other open-source and closed-\\nsource models.

Promote or enable dangerous behaviors to the user or other people.\\n3. Contain, promote or enable offensive and abusive behavior towards the user or other people.\\n4. Contain, promote or enable sexually explicit content.\\nA.5.3\\nQuality Assurance Process\\nWe have implemented a quality assurance process to ensure we only use high quality annotations for training\\nthe model. For this process, a team of highly skilled content managers manually reviewed the annotations\\nand approved the ones that would be used.\\nDuring the quality assurance step, reviewers were asked to only approve those annotations that matched our\\nguidelines: (a) they are consistent with the dialogue history, (b) follow instructions in the prompt (c) are\\nfree of grammatical, spelling and other writing errors, and (d) do not fall into any of the categories described\\nin Section A.5.2. If an annotation needed small changes to be approved, due to grammar or spelling mistakes,\\nor to improve the structure, cohesiveness and style of the text, reviewers could edit it to fix the issues and\\napprove it. If the answer could not be approved without major changes, the reviewers were asked to reject it\\nand write the feedback necessary to improve it.\\nA.5.4\\nAnnotator Selection\\nTo select the annotators who could work on our different data collection tasks, we conducted a multi-step\\nassessment process where we tested their understanding of our guidelines, the alignment with our quality\\nassessment criteria, the alignment with our sensitive topics guidelines and their reading and writing skills.\\nThe process included 4 tests:\\n• The first test consists of 3 sections of testing to evaluate grammar, reading comprehension and writing\\nstyle. Each section is timed and the test should take a total of 50 minutes to complete. A candidate\\nmust score 90% on part I to continue on to parts II and III, and an average score of 4 on part II and III\\nto pass the test.\\n• The second test consisted of 42 questions split into sensitive topics alignment, answer ranking and\\ntwo examples of answer writing, which were manually reviewed by us. To pass the test, annotators\\nneeded to agree with our criteria on 80% of the answers, and pass the written examples with a score\\nof 4 out of 5.\\n74\\n\\n\\n• The third test consisted in measuring the alignment with our quality assessment criteria. The test\\nconsisted of 31 different questions asking the annotators to grade different prompt-answer pairs,\\nas well as ranking different answers to the same prompt. To measure alignment, we first collected\\nresponses from different team members, and the annotators who agreed with our preferences in\\nmore than 26 of the questions passed the test.\\n• Finally, the last test consisted of a prompt response assessment where annotators choose a minimum of\\n6 out of 18 prompts to write responses for. We manually assess each response to evaluate production\\nreadiness. Annotators that have scored an average of >4 have passed the training.\\nA.6\\nDataset Contamination\\nWith the increasing scale of publicly available training data, it has become inevitable that some portion of\\nevaluation data is seen during training, and may provide an undue boost in evaluation performance.\\nEarlier work (Brown et al.\\n---------------------\\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\\nQuery: What is the significance of the Section A.1 in the paper?\\nAnswer: ', '4': 'Context information is below.\\n---------------------\\n. . . . . . . .\\n77\\n2\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: Helpfulness human evaluation results for Llama\\n2-Chat compared to other open-source and closed-source\\nmodels.

To remove\\nties, we used win/(win + loss). The orders in\\nwhich the model responses are presented to\\nGPT-4 are randomly swapped to alleviate bias.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise as highly capable AI assistants that excel in\\ncomplex reasoning tasks requiring expert knowledge across a wide range of fields, including in specialized\\ndomains such as programming and creative writing. They enable interaction with humans through intuitive\\nchat interfaces, which has led to rapid and widespread adoption among the general public.\\nThe capabilities of LLMs are remarkable considering the seemingly straightforward nature of the training\\nmethodology. Auto-regressive transformers are pretrained on an extensive corpus of self-supervised data,\\nfollowed by alignment with human preferences via techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human\\nFeedback (RLHF). Although the training methodology is simple, high computational requirements have\\nlimited the development of LLMs to a few players. There have been public releases of pretrained LLMs\\n(such as BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), LLaMa-1 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023)) that\\nmatch the performance of closed pretrained competitors like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and Chinchilla\\n(Hoffmann et al., 2022), but none of these models are suitable substitutes for closed “product” LLMs, such\\nas ChatGPT, BARD, and Claude. These closed product LLMs are heavily fine-tuned to align with human\\npreferences, which greatly enhances their usability and safety. This step can require significant costs in\\ncompute and human annotation, and is often not transparent or easily reproducible, limiting progress within\\nthe community to advance AI alignment research.\\nIn this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a family of pretrained and fine-tuned LLMs, Llama 2 and\\nLlama 2-Chat, at scales up to 70B parameters. On the series of helpfulness and safety benchmarks we tested,\\nLlama 2-Chat models generally perform better than existing open-source models. They also appear to\\nbe on par with some of the closed-source models, at least on the human evaluations we performed (see\\nFigures 1 and 3). We have taken measures to increase the safety of these models, using safety-specific data\\nannotation and tuning, as well as conducting red-teaming and employing iterative evaluations. Additionally,\\nthis paper contributes a thorough description of our fine-tuning methodology and approach to improving\\nLLM safety. We hope that this openness will enable the community to reproduce fine-tuned LLMs and\\ncontinue to improve the safety of those models, paving the way for more responsible development of LLMs.\\nWe also share novel observations we made during the development of Llama 2 and Llama 2-Chat, such as\\nthe emergence of tool usage and temporal organization of knowledge.\\n3\\n---------------------\\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\\nQuery: How do the Llama 2-Chat models compare to open-source chat models based on the benchmarks tested?\\nAnswer: ', '5': 'Context information is below.\\n---------------------\\nLlama 2: Open Foundation and Fine-Tuned Chat Models\\nHugo Touvron∗\\nLouis Martin†\\nKevin Stone†\\nPeter Albert Amjad Almahairi Yasmine Babaei Nikolay Bashlykov Soumya Batra\\nPrajjwal Bhargava Shruti Bhosale Dan Bikel Lukas Blecher Cristian Canton Ferrer Moya Chen\\nGuillem Cucurull David Esiobu Jude Fernandes Jeremy Fu Wenyin Fu Brian Fuller\\nCynthia Gao Vedanuj Goswami Naman Goyal Anthony Hartshorn Saghar Hosseini Rui Hou\\nHakan Inan Marcin Kardas Viktor Kerkez Madian Khabsa Isabel Kloumann Artem Korenev\\nPunit Singh Koura Marie-Anne Lachaux Thibaut Lavril Jenya Lee Diana Liskovich\\nYinghai Lu Yuning Mao Xavier Martinet Todor Mihaylov Pushkar Mishra\\nIgor Molybog Yixin Nie Andrew Poulton Jeremy Reizenstein Rashi Rungta Kalyan Saladi\\nAlan Schelten Ruan Silva Eric Michael Smith Ranjan Subramanian Xiaoqing Ellen Tan Binh Tang\\nRoss Taylor Adina Williams Jian Xiang Kuan Puxin Xu Zheng Yan Iliyan Zarov Yuchen Zhang\\nAngela Fan Melanie Kambadur Sharan Narang Aurelien Rodriguez Robert Stojnic\\nSergey Edunov\\nThomas Scialom∗\\nGenAI, Meta\\nAbstract\\nIn this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned\\nlarge language models (LLMs) ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters.\\nOur fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama 2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases.

Human raters judged model generations for safety violations across ~2,000 adversarial\\nprompts consisting of both single and multi-turn prompts. More details can be found in Section 4.4. It is\\nimportant to caveat these safety results with the inherent bias of LLM evaluations due to limitations of the\\nprompt set, subjectivity of the review guidelines, and subjectivity of individual raters. Additionally, these\\nsafety evaluations are performed using content standards that are likely to be biased towards the Llama\\n2-Chat models.\\nWe are releasing the following models to the general public for research and commercial use‡:\\n1. Llama 2, an updated version of Llama 1, trained on a new mix of publicly available data. We also\\nincreased the size of the pretraining corpus by 40%, doubled the context length of the model, and\\nadopted grouped-query attention (Ainslie et al., 2023). We are releasing variants of Llama 2 with\\n7B, 13B, and 70B parameters. We have also trained 34B variants, which we report on in this paper\\nbut are not releasing.§\\n2. Llama 2-Chat, a fine-tuned version of Llama 2 that is optimized for dialogue use cases. We release\\nvariants of this model with 7B, 13B, and 70B parameters as well.\\nWe believe that the open release of LLMs, when done safely, will be a net benefit to society. Like all LLMs,\\nLlama 2 is a new technology that carries potential risks with use (Bender et al., 2021b; Weidinger et al., 2021;\\nSolaiman et al., 2023). Testing conducted to date has been in English and has not — and could not — cover\\nall scenarios. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 2-Chat, developers should perform\\nsafety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model. We provide a responsible use\\nguide¶ and code examples‖ to facilitate the safe deployment of Llama 2 and Llama 2-Chat. More details of\\nour responsible release strategy can be found in Section 5.3.\\nThe remainder of this paper describes our pretraining methodology (Section 2), fine-tuning methodology\\n(Section 3), approach to model safety (Section 4), key observations and insights (Section 5), relevant related\\nwork (Section 6), and conclusions (Section 7).\\n‡https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama/\\n§We are delaying the release of the 34B model due to a lack of time to sufficiently red team.\\n¶https://ai.meta.com/llama\\n‖https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama\\n4\\n---------------------\\nGiven the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query.\\nQuery: What is the main focus of the paper's approach to fine-tuning and safety improvements of Llama 2-Chat?\\nAnswer: \"}\n",
